# A* Haversine
> A* Algorithm Implemented with Haversine Distance

The A* algorithm is a search algorithm, mainly used for shortest path-finding,
that utilizes a heuristic that estimates the cost to reach a specific destination.

This implementation is geared towards using [Haversine Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)
to estimate the target node.
